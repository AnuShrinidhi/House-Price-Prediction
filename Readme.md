Predicting house prices is an important objective. Recent studies have found that asset prices can help to forecast output and inflation. Changes in housing prices can provide knowledge about consumption and inflation. In the business cycle, housing market play an important role. Studying Housing sales and prices is necessary to understand demand and supply.

Models that can forecast housing prices can provide policy makers and economists with an idea about the future economy and therefore, help them design better policies. It can also help economists to estimate prepayments, housing mortgage and housing affordability. In recent years, machine learning has become a popular approach to predict house prices based on its attributes. Predicting house prices is usually approached as a regression problem.

Recommendations from the case study are:

The ideal lambda value in case of Ridge and Lasso is as below:

Ridge - 5 Lasso - 0.0004 The Mean Squared error in case of Ridge and Lasso are:

Ridge - 0.013710 Lasso - 0.0135357 The Mean Squared Error of Lasso is slightly lower than that of Ridge

Also, since Lasso helps in feature reduction (as the coefficient value of one of the feature became 0), Lasso has a better edge over Ridge.

Hence based on Lasso, the factors that generally affect the price are the Zoning classification, Living area square feet, Overall quality and condition of the house, Foundation type of the house, Number of cars that can be accomodated in the garage, Total basement area in square feet and the Basement finished square feet area

Therefore, the variables predicted by Lasso in the above bar chart as significant variables for predicting the price of a house.
